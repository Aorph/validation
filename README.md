# Validation

This is The data folder and the mysql dump you need.

Infos you may need too :

DB name : **musicStore**.
Username and pass are as usual.

Two main pages : CD page and Instrument page.
Do not attempt to make any sense of the actual datas present in the DB... Just...Please don't...There is none..

*The many to many relationship is set between the* CDs *and their* Genres.

I hope the front is not *that* ugly... At least it is a bit responsive.

Making CRUD and routes was quite easy and fast. Except a few variables mistakes, it was all good.

However i had a lot of troubles with the manytomany relationship... A freaking lot... I could make the migrations and models with some research. I was then stuck when i had to use the Attach() and detach() method... 

I had to copy/paste it from an old laravel project on a usb Key after more than 4 hours of research in total on "how to make a many to many relationship". That was the only time i did it...

So in the end, making a CRUD was easy, but i couldn't do the manytomany relationship without a model.

Thank you anyways for all i did in front of this computer... see you soon !














Wait....Is that a button on "price" ?...
